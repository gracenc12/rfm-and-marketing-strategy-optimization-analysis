# Marketing Data Analytics: RFM Segmentation and Marketing Strategy Optimization

## Background
A company operating in the retail industry sells a wide range of products through multiple channels, including website, catalog, and offline stores.  
The company generates revenue from purchases made by customers with diverse profiles (e.g., ID, Date of Birth, Marital Status, Education, Income, Number of Kids/Teens, Days Since Last Purchase, Date Joined, and Customer Complaint Data).

Despite having a large customer base, the company faces challenges in optimizing its marketing efforts due to the lack of targeted and efficient strategies. Therefore, data-driven insights are needed to enhance marketing effectiveness and improve customer engagement through **segmented marketing**.

## Problem Statement
The company has been running various marketing campaigns. However, **customer response to marketing campaigns remains relatively low**, indicating that the **marketing strategy is not yet effective and efficient**.  
This condition suggests that marketing budget allocation may not be optimized and could hinder revenue growth. Hence, the company needs a strategic data analysis approach to improve marketing efficiency through segmentation.

## Goals (Objectives)
- Identify customer segmentation using RFM analysis to understand behavior, value, and treatment strategy.  
- Optimize marketing campaign strategies to increase campaign effectiveness and efficiency.  
- Analyze discount strategy performance to drive more transactions.  
- Identify characteristics of high-value customers to guide new customer acquisition strategies.

## Tools & Libraries
- **Python**: Data preprocessing, analysis, and visualization  
- **Pandas, NumPy**: Data manipulation and aggregation  
- **Matplotlib, Seaborn**: Visualization  
- **SciPy**: Statistical tests and correlations  
- **Tableau**: Dashboard visualization and storytelling  

## Output
- Customer segmentation based on RFM scoring  
- Campaign response analysis per segment  
- Discount purchase behavior insights per segment
- Marketing recommendations for each customer group  

## Key Insight
This project helps the company understand customer behavior and design more personalized marketing strategies based on RFM segmentation and marketing performance.
